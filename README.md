*   **Customizable Stages:** Define and manage ticket stages (e.g., New, In Progress, Solved).
*   **Tagging System:** Categorize tickets using customizable tags.
*   **Customer Portal:** Allow customers to view their tickets and interact with support agents.
*   **Email Integration:** Send and receive ticket updates via email.
*   **Reporting:** Basic reporting and analytics on ticket volume and performance.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the Odoo environment and install the custom helpdesk module.

### Prerequisites

*   Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
*   PostgreSQL
*   Python 3.11
*   Git

### 1. Database Setup

This project supports both local and remote PostgreSQL databases.

#### Option A: Remote PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)

If you have a remote PostgreSQL database (like Render, AWS RDS, etc.), update the `odoo.conf` file with your database credentials:

```bash
# Edit odoo.conf with your database details
db_host = your-postgres-host.com
db_port = 5432
db_user = your_username
db_password = your_password
```

Then run the database setup script:

```bash
python3 setup_database.py
```

#### Option B: Local PostgreSQL (Development)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y postgresql postgresql-contrib
sudo systemctl start postgresql
sudo systemctl enable postgresql
sudo su - postgres -c "createuser -s $USER"
```

### 3. Clone the Odoo Repository

This repository contains the Odoo source code along with the `custom_helpdesk` module.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kaljuvee/odoo.git /home/ubuntu/odoo-setup/odoo
cd /home/ubuntu/odoo-setup/odoo
```

### 4. Install Python Dependencies

Install the required Python packages using the requirements file:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Install System Dependencies

Install `wkhtmltopdf` for PDF generation and PostgreSQL development headers:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y wkhtmltopdf postgresql postgresql-contrib
```

### 6. Initialize the Odoo Database

Copy the custom helpdesk module and initialize the database:

```bash
cp -r custom_helpdesk odoo/addons/
cd odoo
python3 odoo-bin -c ../odoo.conf --init=custom_helpdesk --stop-after-init
```

### 7. Start the Odoo Server

Run the following command to start the Odoo server:

```bash
python3 odoo-bin -c ../odoo.conf
```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8069`.

## Configuration

After installation, you can configure the helpdesk module from the Odoo interface.

1.  **Log in to Odoo:** Use the default credentials (admin/admin) to log in.
2.  **Navigate to Helpdesk:** Click on the "Helpdesk" menu icon in the main dashboard.
3.  **Configure Teams, Stages, and Tags:**
    *   Go to **Helpdesk > Configuration > Teams** to create and manage support teams.
    *   Go to **Helpdesk > Configuration > Stages** to define the ticket workflow stages.
    *   Go to **Helpdesk > Configuration > Tags** to create tags for categorizing tickets.

## Usage
